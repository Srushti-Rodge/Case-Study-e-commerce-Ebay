## Overview
Part I of the document provided above is a case study focused on an e-commerce platform. It includes a detailed analysis of the product, covering its features, impacts, real-world challenges, and the solutions implemented by the platform. Additionally, a hypothetical database schema was designed and presented, illustrating how it could support the platform's operational growth. The document also identifies current challenges faced by the platform and proposes strategies aimed at overcoming these obstacles to achieve a 25% increase in revenue and profit within one year.

### Problem Statement
**1. Absence of Online Marketplaces:** Before eBay, there were no all-encompassing online platforms where individuals could easily buy and sell a broad variety of products.

**2. Geographic Restrictions:** Buyers and sellers were constrained by geographical boundaries, making it challenging to engage in international trade.

**3. Limited Product Variety:** Traditional e-commerce platforms often specialized in specific product categories, lacking a broad assortment of items.

**4. Trust and Feedback Mechanism:** There was no dependable system for feedback and trust, making online transactions potentially risky.

**5. Inadequate Payment Systems:** Early e-commerce platforms had unreliable payment infrastructures, discouraging users from engaging in online transactions.

### Result
**1. Pioneering Auction Model:** eBay launched an online auction system, establishing a vibrant and competitive marketplace.

**2. Worldwide Access:** eBay allowed users from around the globe to buy and sell, making international trade more accessible.

**3. Extensive Product Variety:** eBay offered a wide array of products, appealing to a diverse and expansive user base.

**4. Trust and Feedback Mechanism:** eBay introduced a feedback system that fostered trust and reliability within the community.

eBay's groundbreaking solutions revolutionized the e-commerce industry, effectively tackling major challenges and establishing new trends in online retail.
